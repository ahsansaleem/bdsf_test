    "3- This query is retrieving all the data from the table OLYM_Athletes namely ID\tATHLETE_NAME ATHLETE_GENDER. Select  * means to retrieve all the columns. Since there is no where condition we are also retrieving all rows.\n",
    "4- This query is specifically retrieving the columns ATHLETE_NAME ATHLETE_GENDER from the table OLYM_Athletes. Furthermore only rows where the ATHLETE_GENDERS = female are being retrieved. This is contrary to query in part 3 where we were retrieving all columns and all rows without a conditional statement.\n",
